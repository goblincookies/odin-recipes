    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound 93/7 ground beef</li>
        <li>3 cups thinly sliced cabbage</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups thinly sliced red bell pepper</li>
        <li>3 garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken stock</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons hoisin sauce</li>
        <li>2 (3 ounce) packages instant ramen noodles
            (seasoning packet discarded)</li>
        <li>1 cup matchstick carrots</li>
        <li>thinly sliced scallions</li>
        <li>toasted sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Heat a medium Dutch oven over medium-high heat.
            Add the beef; cook, stirring occasionally to
            break the meat into crumbles, until browned
            and no longer pink, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in cabbage, bell peppers, and garlic.
            Cook, stirring often, until vegetables begin
            to wilt and cabbage is translucent, about 5
            minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in chicken broth, soy sauce, hoisin sauce;
            bring it to a boil over medium high heat. Once
            at a boil, nestle in ramen, spooning the beef
            mixture over the ramen as needed to make sure
            the ramen is fully submerged. Reduce the heat
            to medium. Cover and cook, undisturbed, until
            the ramen is tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in
            carrots. Cover and remove from heat. Let sit
            until carrots are tender, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Garnish with scallions and sesame seeds. Serve.</li>
    </ol>
